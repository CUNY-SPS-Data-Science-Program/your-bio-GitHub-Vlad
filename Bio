My name is Vladimir Nimchenko. I currently work as a Business Intelligence Developer for the Office of Data Management and Analysis Services at Brooklyn College. I have a BA in Mathematics and an MS in Information Systems. You can contact me via Slack/CUNY email (VLADIMIR.NIMCHENKO97@spsmail.cuny.edu). My LinkedIn is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-nimchenko-69643630/. My job requires me to work and analyze all sorts of data (Budget, Student Financials….) pertaining to the college. I love working with data and want to learn more techniques in making the most the of the data. I am comfortable with all three languages: Python, R and Java Script. I was able to gain valuable hands on experience inPython and R during the course of this program. In regards to Java Script, I utilize the language for some personal projects. I would say I have intermediate experience in all three languages. I have no experience with a Geographic Information System. My objectives in this program is to get a better grasp of how to manipulate data from A to Z, going through all the steps starting from data acquisition to data wrangling …. all the way to data analysis (visualizations). In summary, my goal is to acquire data, turn it into meaningful information and derive valuable knowledge/insight from the information. From this course, I hope to get a better understanding on how to visually represent data. I want to better understand the purpose of each visualization so I can depict the data to my audience in a way which is most beneficial to my audience. Throughout the program, so far, I have some experience using the GGplot library (In R) and Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries(In Python). At work I utilize Microsoft Power BI. Visualizing a productive and enjoyable semester!
