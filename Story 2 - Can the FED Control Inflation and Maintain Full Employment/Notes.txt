Project Goal: control inflation and maintain low unemployment


CPI on Inflation:
-The decrease in CPI indicates that the current year CPI is below the base year. The price 
 will also be less than the base price year level. Thus inflation will decrease.

Unemployment on Inflation:
-When inflation rises unemployment drops. Higher unemployment equates to lower inflation. 
 When more people are working, they have the power to spend which leads to increase in 
 demand and higher inflation.

Federal Funds rate on Inflation:
-Because higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs, people will eventually start 
 spending less. The demand for goods and services will then drop, which will cause 
 inflation to fall.

Summary:
Increase in Price = Increase in CPI = Increase Inflation = Lower unemployment 
= Increase Federal Funds Rate


Solution:
The Fed's Goal is to have a 2% inflation rate and to maximize employment
